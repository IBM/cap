# cap
The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) allows emergency messages to be simultaneously disseminated over a wide variety of existing and emerging public alerting systems.

## Project Purpose
This project is for providing client libraries, and examples, for integration with CAP message providers in one or more somewhat popular languages for container hosted services (rust, golang, js, swift, python, php, etc.).
For example, they will provide code to enable a client application to push, pull, and parse CAP messages with a CAP message provider such as the [US National Weather Service](https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/).

## Call for Code
This is a [Call for Code](https://callforcode.org/) (C4C) project for other C4C projects to build on. C4C is a multi-year global initiative asking developers to use their skills and mastery of the latest technologies, to drive positive change across the world through their code.

## CAP Description
CAP is an international technical data specification developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards ([OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org)).
* In addition to the basic CAP standard, The US based Federal Emergency Management Agency ([FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)) created a technical specification called Integrated Public Alert and Warning System ([IPAWS](https://www.fema.gov/ipaws-components)).
* FEMA has formally adopted CAP and IPAWS to implement it's warning systems.
For a detailed description see [OASIS CAP Specification]( https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/105521).
